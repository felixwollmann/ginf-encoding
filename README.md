# ❓ What is this

In school, in the subject GINF (German: "Grundlagen Informatik", which would best be translated to "Computer Science Fundamentals"), we learned about character encoding, and looked at an extremely simple example.

## 📕 Characters
The characters in this encoding are limited to *ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.,\*:-#* and whitespace.

These are encoded in that order, from `00000` (binary) to `11111`, with the whitespace as `00000`. So, A is `00001` and # is `11111`. There are no lower case letters.
